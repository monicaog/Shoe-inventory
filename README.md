The program has a Shoe class that contains the attributes of each shoe object: country, code, product, cost, and quantity. The shoe objects are stored in a list called shoe_list. The program also has functions for reading data from a text file, capturing new shoe data from the user, viewing all the shoes in the list, and searching for a specific shoe based on its code.

Installation: Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Clone or download the code to your local machine. Run the code in a Python environment, such as IDLE or terminal.

Usage: To run the program, execute the code in a Python environment. The program will prompt the user to select an option from the main menu. Options include reading data from a text file, capturing new shoe data, viewing all the shoes, and searching for a specific shoe. If the user chooses to read data from a text file, they must ensure the file is in the same directory as the code and is named "inventory.txt". The file should contain data in the following format: country, code, product, cost, quantity. If the user chooses to capture new shoe data, they will be prompted to enter the country, code, product, cost, and quantity for each shoe. If the user chooses to view all the shoes, the program will print the details of all the shoe objects in the list. If the user chooses to search for a specific shoe, they will be prompted to enter the code, and the program will search for the corresponding shoe in the list and print its details.
